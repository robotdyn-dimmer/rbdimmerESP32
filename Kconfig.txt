    config RBDIMMER_MAX_CHANNELS
        int "Maximum number of dimmer channels"
        default 8
        range 1 16
        help
            Sets the maximum number of dimmer channels that can be created.
            Each channel controls one dimmer output.
            Default is 8 channels, which is suitable for most applications.
            Reduce this value to save memory in constrained systems.

    config RBDIMMER_MAX_PHASES
        int "Maximum number of AC phases"
        default 4
        range 1 4
        help
            Sets the maximum number of AC phases supported.
            For single-phase systems, set to 1.
            For three-phase systems, set to 3.
            Default is 4 to support three-phase + neutral configurations.

    config RBDIMMER_DEFAULT_PULSE_WIDTH_US
        int "Default TRIAC pulse width (microseconds)"
        default 50
        range 20 200
        help
            Sets the default pulse width for TRIAC triggering in microseconds.
            This value should match your dimmer hardware specifications.
            Default is 50us, which works with most TRIAC dimmers.
            WARNING: Do not change unless you know your hardware requirements!

    config RBDIMMER_MIN_DELAY_US
        int "Minimum triggering delay (microseconds)"
        default 50
        range 20 500
        help
            Sets the minimum delay before TRIAC can be triggered after zero-cross.
            This ensures safe TRIAC operation and prevents misfiring.
            Default is 50us, suitable for most applications.

    config RBDIMMER_DEFAULT_FREQUENCY
        int "Default mains frequency (Hz)"
        default 0
        range 0 60
        help
            Sets the default mains frequency in Hz.
            Set to 0 for automatic frequency detection (recommended).
            Set to 50 for 50Hz mains (Europe, Asia, Africa).
            Set to 60 for 60Hz mains (Americas, parts of Asia).

    config RBDIMMER_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG
        bool "Enable debug logging"
        default n
        help
            Enables detailed debug logging for troubleshooting.
            This will increase code size and may impact performance.
            Enable only during development or when debugging issues.

    config RBDIMMER_USE_RTOS_TRANSITIONS
        bool "Use FreeRTOS tasks for smooth transitions"
        default y
        help
            Enables smooth brightness transitions using FreeRTOS tasks.
            When enabled, rbdimmer_set_level_transition() creates a task
            that smoothly changes brightness over time.
            Disable to save memory if smooth transitions are not needed.

    config RBDIMMER_TRANSITION_TASK_STACK_SIZE
        int "Transition task stack size (bytes)"
        default 2048
        range 1024 4096
        depends on RBDIMMER_USE_RTOS_TRANSITIONS
        help
            Stack size for brightness transition tasks in bytes.
            Increase if you experience stack overflow in transition tasks.
            Default 2048 bytes is suitable for most applications.

    config RBDIMMER_TRANSITION_TASK_PRIORITY
        int "Transition task priority"
        default 5
        range 1 25
        depends on RBDIMMER_USE_RTOS_TRANSITIONS
        help
            FreeRTOS priority for brightness transition tasks.
            Higher number = higher priority.
            Default 5 is medium priority, suitable for most applications.

    choice RBDIMMER_DEFAULT_CURVE
        prompt "Default brightness curve"
        default RBDIMMER_DEFAULT_CURVE_RMS
        help
            Select the default brightness curve for new channels.
            This can be changed per channel at runtime.

        config RBDIMMER_DEFAULT_CURVE_LINEAR
            bool "Linear"
            help
                Simple linear mapping. May not provide linear perceived brightness.

        config RBDIMMER_DEFAULT_CURVE_RMS
            bool "RMS Compensated"
            help
                Compensates for RMS power delivery. Best for incandescent bulbs.

        config RBDIMMER_DEFAULT_CURVE_LOGARITHMIC
            bool "Logarithmic"
            help
                Logarithmic curve for linear perceived brightness. Best for LED loads.

    config RBDIMMER_ISR_IRAM_SAFE
        bool "Place ISR handlers in IRAM"
        default y
        help
            Places interrupt handlers in IRAM for faster execution.
            Disable only if you have severe IRAM constraints.
            WARNING: Disabling may cause timing issues!

    config RBDIMMER_STATS_ENABLED
        bool "Enable statistics collection"
        default n
        help
            Enables collection of runtime statistics like interrupt count,
            timing accuracy, etc. Useful for performance analysis.
            Increases memory usage and processing overhead.
